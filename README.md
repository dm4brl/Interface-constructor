It seems like you've provided a description of the "DatabaseConfig" structure, the "PostgreSQLDatabaseService" structure and constructor, the use of Viper for configuration data, and the purpose of the main function in your code. This information gives a high-level overview of the structure and purpose of your code for working with PostgreSQL.

If you have any specific questions or if there's anything specific you would like to know or discuss regarding this code, please feel free to ask, and I'll be happy to assist you further.


# Interface-method-and-constructor
Interface method and constructor architecture with interface configuration option to work with PostgreSQL. This approach allows you to create configurable database service instances


The "PostgreSQLDatabaseService" structure and constructor implementation:

DatabaseService interface: Defines methods to be implemented by all database services. This interface provides an abstraction for database operations and includes the following methods:

Connect() (*pgx.Conn, error): Establishes a connection to the database and returns a connection object (pgx.Conn) or an error if no connection is established.

Close(conn *pgx.Conn): Closes the database connection, taking the connection object as a parameter.

InsertData(conn *pgx.Conn, data string) error: Inserts data into the database using the connection object and returns an error if something went wrong.

GetData(conn *pgx.Conn) (string, error): Retrieves data from the database using a connection object and returns the retrieved data and an error if there was a problem.

DatabaseConfig structure: Stores the parameters for connecting to a PostgreSQL database. This structure contains the following fields:

Host (database host).

Port (database port).

User (database user name).

Password (database user password).

Database (database name).
